            <h2>CSS for accessibility</h2>
            <p>There are several easy ways to add usability and accessibility to your webpages using just CSS. Read below for several great tips.</p>

                <h2>Step 1. Style for comfortable reading</h2>
                <p>No one wants to read bright red text on a black background, nor do they likely want to figure out what your microscopic text is <em>really</em> saying.</p>
                <p>Instead, always use styling to your advantage. First and foremost, your content should have a clear hierarchy with a good mix of comfortable and legible font sizes, weights, spacing, and so forth. After all, you want your users to come back to your site.</p>

                <h2>Step 2. Adding contrast</h2>
                <p>While the concept is very similar to Step 1 above, adding simple styles for contrast (while still being comfortable to read) can go a long way.</p>
                <p>For instance, when you create a link on your webpage, you want users to clearly understand it’s a link. If it blends in with the rest of your text, it might cause confusion. That’s why links usually are underlined with a different color. You may experiment with other styles to further its convenience & usability.</p>

                <h2>Step 3. Allow the option of overriding styles</h2>
                <p>Allowing users to override your CSS styles may be beneficial for a variety of reasons. For example, a user may want to enlarge the text on every website they visit, or they may want high contrasting colors. If  you test your site to see it can handle larger text sizes without breaking, it would greatly improve usability for your users.</p>
