            <p>There are several easy ways to add usability and accessibility to your webpages using just HTML. Read below for several great tips.</p>

                <h2>Step 1. Use the right HTML element</h2>
                <p>This may seem obvious, but it can be all too easy to apply a general tag when there are several semantic tags that can do the job better. For example, one could use a
                    tags for a button, but using the semantic tag
                        button is much more descriptive. But why does it matter?</p>
                <p>One word: <strong>Screen readers!</strong> A descriptive tag is much more useful for those to determine what piece of content they are dealing with. Other reasons?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Descriptive for screen readers</li>
                    <li>Easier to understand</li>
                    <li>Better for SEO.</li>

                <h2>Step 2. Your language should be clear</h2>
                <p>For screenreaders, it may be difficult to understand the content if the website's content is not laid out in a clear, precise manner. <strong>Some general tips include:</strong> no abbreviations if possible (write out "February" instead
                    of "Feb"), avoiding dashes ("10 to 12" instead of "10-12"), and writing acronyms out. By using these tips, you'll be able to provide easy-to-read content for everyone accessing your website.</p>

                <h2>Step 3. Apply a modern website structure</h2>
                <p>Back in the 'old days' days of web development, many would apply table layouts for their design. While it may have made sense back then, nowadays such a layout will bloat your code, your design will be inflexible, and most importantly,
                    will create a real headache for screenreaders to understand your content.</p>
                <p>Instead, you're much better off applying <strong>modern HTML5 semantic tags</strong> to designate your content throughout (think headers, footers, nav, sections).</p>
