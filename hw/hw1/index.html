            <h2>What is Accessibility?</h2>
            <p>It's great to create a dynamic and interesting website, but it is also important to make sure your website is user-friendly. Web accessibility allows as many people as possible to access the content of your website. Generally, disabilities usually
                come to mind when a developer thinks of accessibility, but it can also mean those who have to deal with a slow internet connection, or those using a mobile device.</p>
            <p>Quote about accessibility:</p>
            <blockquote>Another important area of professionalism is accessibility awareness. Everyone should be accommodated, especially when around 20 per cent of the population have special requirements. In fact, Microsoft said recently that nearly 50 per cent of people need to make some sort of adjustment to their system to interact with it. Having turned 50, I’m very aware of receiving email with very small fonts – people don’t want to use their spectacles to look at a Web page! by British Computer Society</blockquote>

                <p>When we create a website with accessibility in mind, we should take special care to make sure those who may not be able to see, hear, or move are able to read your content off of your site.</p>

                <li><span class="bold-green">Mobility:</span> To help those who may not be able to move around on the computer as well, adding special features for key accessibility can help (such as being able to use the 'TAB' key to move around on a form).</li>
